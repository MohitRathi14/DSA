# Explanation of the Java Code

## Code Purpose
The given Java program uses a stack to demonstrate how an element can be **conditionally inserted at the bottom** of the stack using recursion. It defines two critical methods in the `MyStackInsertElement` class:

1. **`addElement`**:  
   This method:
    - Initializes a stack (`s1`) and pushes a series of elements onto it.
    - Prints the initial state of the stack.
    - Calls the `insertAtBottom` method to attempt adding a specific element (`100`) to the bottom of the stack under certain conditions.
    - Prints the updated state of the stack after the operation.

2. **`insertAtBottom`**:  
   This recursive method:
    - Adds an element (`x`) to the bottom of the stack.
    - Applies conditional logic to only insert `x` if the current stack size is **less than 3**.
    - Uses recursion to temporarily remove elements from the stack until the base case is reached, then reinserts them in reverse order after adding the new element.

---

## Detailed Execution Process

### `addElement` Method
1. A new stack `s1` is created.
2. Five integers (`78, 45, 65, 67, 69`) are pushed onto the stack.
3. The stack (from top to bottom) will initially look like:
   ```
   [69, 67, 65, 45, 78]
   ```
4. The `insertAtBottom` method is called with arguments `s1` and `100`.
5. After the `insertAtBottom` call, the contents of the modified stack are printed.

---

### `insertAtBottom` Method
1. **Base Case 1**:
    - If the stack's size is less than 3, `x` (`100`) is pushed onto the stack. Recursion ends here.

2. **Base Case 2**:
    - If the stack is empty, the method simply returns. (This handles edge cases but is not used in the current example.)

3. **Recursive Case**:
    - The top element of the stack is temporarily removed (popped).
    - The method calls itself recursively on the remaining stack to handle further elements.
    - Once the recursive call returns, the previously popped element is pushed back onto the stack to preserve the original order above the inserted element.

## Execution Walkthrough

### Initial Stack
Before the `insertAtBottom` method is called:

[69, 67, 65, 45, 78]


### Recursive Steps of `insertAtBottom`
1. The topmost element (`69`) is popped off, reducing the stack to:
   ```
   [67, 65, 45, 78]
   ```
   The method continues recursively.

2. The next element (`67`) is popped off:
   ```
   [65, 45, 78]
   ```

3. The next element (`65`) is popped off:
   ```
   [45, 78]
   ```

4. Now the stack size is less than 3, so `100` is pushed onto the stack:
   ```
   [100, 45, 78]
   ```

---

### Returning from Recursion
As the recursion unwinds:
1. `65` is re-pushed onto the stack:
   ```
   [65, 100, 45, 78]
   ```

2. `67` is re-pushed:
   ```
   [67, 65, 100, 45, 78]
   ```

3. Finally, `69` is re-pushed:
   ```
   [69, 67, 65, 100, 45, 78]
   ```

---

## Final Output

Here is the output of the program:

[69, 67, 65, 45, 78]
Work Done 
[69, 67, 65, 100, 45, 78]


- The first line shows the stack before the `insertAtBottom` operation.
- After inserting `100` and restoring the stackâ€™s order, the final stack is printed.

---

## Summary
This program demonstrates:
- How recursion can be used to manipulate elements in a stack.
- Conditional addition of an element (`100`) based on the size of the stack.

The key idea is that the stack is temporarily modified during recursion, and the original order is preserved after the new element is added at the bottom.
